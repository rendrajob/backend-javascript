# npm Exercise: Publish to npm Package

In this exercise, you will learn how to publish your own package to the npm registry. Publishing your package allows others to use your code and contributes to the open-source community. It’s a great way to share your projects, libraries, and tools with a wider audience.

### Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
- Create a simple Node.js module.
- Prepare the module for publishing.
- Publish the module to the npm registry.
- Manage and update your published package.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- A working Node.js and npm installation.
- An npm account. If you don’t have one, you can create it by running `npm adduser` in your terminal.

### Steps to Publish Your Package

1. **Create Your Module**: Start by creating a new directory for your module, then create the JavaScript file containing your module's code.

2. **Set Up `package.json`**: Use `npm init` to create a `package.json` file that contains metadata about your package, such as its name, version, and description.

3. **Write Your Code**: Implement the functionality of your module and export it using `module.exports`.

4. **Login to npm**: Make sure you are logged in to your npm account using `npm login`.

5. **Publish Your Package**: Run `npm publish` to publish your package to the npm registry.

6. **Update Your Package**: If you make changes to your module, update the version in `package.json` and run `npm publish` again to publish the updated version.

### Example Code

As a simple example, you can use my code or create your own module. This will give you hands-on experience with the entire publishing process.
