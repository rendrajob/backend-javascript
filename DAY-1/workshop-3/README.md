# npm : Installing and Updating Dependencies

Welcome to the hacker workshop 3! In this workshop, we will learn how to install and update dependencies in a Node.js project using npm.

## Step 1: Initialize a New Node.js Project

You can use your project from the latest workshop

## Step 2: Install Initial Dependencies

Install a few dependencies for your project. For example, install `express` and `lodash`.

```sh
npm install express lodash
```

Check the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to verify that the dependencies were added.

## Step 2: Update Dependencies

Check the current version of the installed packages and update them to their latest versions.

```sh
npm outdated
```
